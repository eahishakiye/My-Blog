    <h2>Buganda News</h2>
    <p>
      Uganda developed from the nineteenth century kingdom of Buganda, based
      along the northern shore of Lake Victoria. In 1894 Buganda was declared a
      British protectorate, but the country was never fully colonised. Growing
      self-government through a Legislative and Executive Council led to full
      independence on 9th October 1962. Milton Obote, leader of the Uganda
      People's Congress (UPC), was elected Prime Minister. He was overthrown in
      1971 by Army Chief of Staff, General Idi Amin, who established a brutal
      dictatorship. The Asian Community was expelled in 1972 and intellectuals
      persecuted. Border tension led to an invasion by Tanzania, with support
      from exiled members of the Ugandan National Liberation Front (UNLF).
      President Amin was over-thrown and ill-organised elections in 1980
      returned Obote's UPC to power.

    <h3>President Obote</h3>
    <p>
      President Obote's government relied on the support of the army and soon
      became embroiled in a savage guerrilla war against Mr. Yoweri Museveni's
      National Resistance Army (NRA), who regarded Obote and his supporters as
      criminals. Growing dissent between Acholi and the Langi factions within
      the army resulted in Obote's overthrow by the Acholi, led by General Tito
      Okello Lutwa. Gen. Okello established a military council, but after a
      bitter battle in January 1986, the NRA occupied Kampala and Mr. Museveni
      was installed as President.

    <h3>Uganda's new constitution</h3>
    <p>
      In 1995, Uganda adopted a new constitution. The Constitution provided for
      Presidential, Parliamentary and local elections over the next two years,
      to be held under the existing restrictions on activity by political
      parties. The elections which followed in May and June 1996, for President
      and Parliament respectively, were generally free and fair, notwithstanding
      the ban on party activityA referendum was held in June 2000, which decided
      to maintain the restrictions. A second referendum was held in 2005 which
      decided the return to a multiparty system of Government and elections.
      Uganda's first multi-party elections since 1980 were held on 23rd February
      2006. Multiparty Elections have been held every five years since then.
      Considerable progress has been made in restoring peace across Uganda and
      in rebuilding infrastructure shattered by civil war.
