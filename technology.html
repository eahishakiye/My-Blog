    <h3>Qualcomm's Law Suit</h3>
    <p>
      The Luxembourg-based General Court said the number of hours worked and
      hourly rates used in Qualcomm's claim was "manifestly excessive". Qualcomm
      submitted its legal bill to the European Commission in 2022 after the
      General Court backed the U.S. group's fight against a 997 million euro EU
      antitrust fine issued in 2018 and ordered the regulator to pay Qualcomm's
      legal costs. The Commission, however, disputed the 12,041,755.80 euros
      sought by the company, saying the amount should be 405,315 euros. Qualcomm
      said its legal bill was based on the importance and complexity of the case
      and the quantity of work done by a team of 19. Judges in a ruling dated
      Feb. 29 posted on the court's website dismissed the U.S. company's
      arguments, saying courts were concerned only with the total number of
      hours of work necessary for the legal proceedings, irrespective of the
      number of lawyers involved in the case.

    <h3>Elon Musk Sues OpenAI</h3>
    <p>
      Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has sued ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and its
      CEO, Sam Altman, saying they abandoned the startup's original mission to
      develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity and not for
      profit. The lawsuit filed late on Thursday in California Superior Court in
      San Francisco is a culmination of Musk's long-simmering opposition to the
      startup he co-founded. OpenAI has since become the face of generative AI,
      partly due to billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft (MSFT.O),
      opens new tab. Musk went on to found his own artificial intelligence
      startup, xAI, launched last July. Musk's lawsuit alleges a breach of
      contract, saying Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman originally approached
      him to make an open source, non-profit company, but the startup
      established in 2015 is now focused on making money. Musk said OpenAI's
      three founders originally agreed to work on artificial general
      intelligence (AGI), a concept that machines could handle tasks like a
      human, but in a way that would "benefit humanity," according to the
      lawsuit.

    <h3>Meta News</h3>
    <p>
      Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab said it will stop paying Australian
      news publishers for content that appears on Facebook, setting up a fresh
      battle with Canberra which had led the world with a law that forces
      internet giants to strike licencing deals. News publishers and governments
      like Australia have argued that Facebook and Google unfairly benefit in
      terms of advertising revenue when links to news articles appear on their
      platforms. Meta has been scaling back its promotion of news and political
      content to drive traffic and says news links are now a fraction of users'
      feeds. Meta will discontinue a tab on Facebook which promotes news in
      Australia and the United States, it said in a statement, adding that it
      cancelled the news tab last year in the UK, France and Germany. As a
      result, "we will not enter into new commercial deals for traditional news
      content in these countries and will not offer new Facebook products
      specifically for news publishers," the statement added.
