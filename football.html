    <h3>Liverpool</h3>
    <p>
      Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has responded to Nottingham Forest supporters’
      chant towards Darwin Nunez during Liverpool’s narrow 1-0 victory at the
      City Ground. The Uruguay international, returning to the squad from the
      bench, hit the winner late on, glancing home Alexis Mac Allister’s cross
      in the ninth minute of stoppage time. The striker was introduced to the
      game on the hour mark, replacing Andy Robertson, and was subjected to
      chants of “s*** Andy Carroll” from the home support.

    <h3>Manchester City</h3>
    <p>
      Manchester City and Liverpool are both waiting in the wings for Bayern
      Munich star Jamal Musiala, while Serie A champions Napoli will not
      compromise on any deal to sell Victor Osimhen to Chelsea. Elsewhere,
      Arsenal may lose midfielder Jorginho on a free transfer at the end of the
      season, and Eric Dier will now stay on at his current side Bayern Munich.
